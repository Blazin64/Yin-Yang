# Yin & Yang KDE  ![yin-yang-symbol](yin_yang/ui/assets/icon.png)

Yin & Yang is a KDE tool which easily toggles between Light & Dark themes. You can configure a Hotkey to toggle between Light & Dark or set a fixed Time for automatic theme change. Yin & Yang styles all KDE and QT5 tools. On Top of that it also themes VSCode or VSCodium.
